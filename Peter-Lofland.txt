Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    Inline is column oriented and block is row oriented.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    The element will be placed above all other element on the z-axis. This will act as if there are no other elements around it.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    Select the element and change the display to inline-block. 
    element {
        display: inline-block;
    }


4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    display block: div's, lists, h1-h6 
    display inline: span's, anchor links
    display inline-block: images

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

    The box model is the foundation of CSS. Every element is a box and can be manipulated by changing the value of it's properies. But after declaring sizing, the default box model will add borders and padding on top of the element which may cause elements to overlap or break the flow of the layout.
    The solution to this would be to use the box-sizing property and set the value to border-box. This property will include the padding and border in the element's total given height/width.
